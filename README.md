# EcoGuard-Deforestation-Monitoring

## Overview

EcoGuard is a monitoring system designed to detect and prevent illegal logging activities in forested areas. The system integrates Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) technology with drone platforms to enable wide-area surveillance capabilities. Mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles, EcoGuard combines dual detection mechanisms—sound analysis and image recognition—to identify logging events in real-time. This approach allows for continuous monitoring of remote forest regions, providing timely alerts when unauthorized logging activities are detected. The system serves as a tool for environmental protection agencies and forest management organizations working to combat deforestation and preserve natural ecosystems.
